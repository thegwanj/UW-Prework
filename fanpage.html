        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            AJR was formed in 2005 by three brothers: Adam, Jack, and Ryan (the first letter of their names make up AJR).
            Playing covers and mixing music from their apartment in New York, it wasn't until
            2015 they launched their first official studio album, titled "Living Room". Fast forward
            7 years, the indie band's albums have topped the charts around the globe, gaining a large following, several
            of their songs having won or been nominated for numerous awards. Combining a mix of genres for each and every album,
            you never truly know what the brothers will release next!
